# basic-cljs-proj
This repository contains a very basic clojure-script project setup ready for unit testing using clj-chrome-devtools.

The unit tests run using a headless chrome instance.

This project is based on a project called Tuck (https://github.com/tatut/tuck), but it is a stripped down version for
basic (library-oriented) functionality development and unit testing. Dependencies were updated to the latest versions
and only dependencies relevant to a basic non-ui clojure-script project are kept along with the necessary settings for
basic unit testing of cljs code.
